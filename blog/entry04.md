# Entry 4

### Context
Over the past month I started to plan out my mvp and do parts of my mvp by the deadline I set it to. So far this is my code
```

```
 I have a basic sprite as the user and a sprite representing spike that sends the user to the gameover screen. This week and Next week I am planning on to work on making the levels, collectables and keeping track how many collectables they collected. I also learned more beyond mvp functions that may be helpful to make challenging levels such as double jump and moving enemies that are on (partol).
