# Entry 6
##### 5/30/25
### Content
After completing my [platformer](keithh9704.github.io/sep11-freedom-project) with a beyond mvp functions I set for myself like moving platforms. I was getting ready to [present](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fUoSkmjh4CBsrn9RrNKb3pN7uRgoGRG1-a25Ok0i5gE) my project.
#### Presenting my project in front of the class
When I called to present my project I was caught by surprise because that day I didn't go over what I was going to say in front of the whole class. I went to present and I noticed myself using the same filler word a lot such as "like", not making enough eye contact and I was shaking when I was trying to present my mvp/beyond mvp.

Some takeaways I have from this presentation are:
* During presentation week no matter what day it is, I should spend 15-20 minutes practicing what I will say when I present.
* During the presentation I should calm myself down so I try to make the presentation more interactive with more eye contact.
#### Presenting my project in the expo
The experience I had at the expo to show my project to students in HSTAT was very nerve racking at first but I realized these people are here to be inspired on what we do for the SEP course. Having this mindset stuck to my head, I was ready to present to these people in the two periods we have to present. In the first period no one came to my side but one person and they seemed really uninterested so I got my main points down to them like how to play my game, what I used to make my project, the different features of my game, etc. In the second period there were a lot of people that came to my side and I presented to my friends that are not in sep, juniors and seniors. Most of them liked my project and some of them thought this game should be copyrighted because of my sprite. Overall I had a really fun time during 2nd period and having this expo was fun because I got to show my friends, juniors and seniors what I was up to in this class.

My Takeaway from the expo are:
* Be more clear so my presentation would flow better. The reason for this takeaway was because when presenting to the judges, I knew what I was going to show them and say to them but the way I would transition from one thing to another wasn't the greatest.
* Find better ways to show your project to others because when I had gifs on google slides, they would be really laggy and take up to 10-20 seconds to fully load in.
### EDP
I am currently on the 8th stage of the Engineering Design Process and this stage was to communicate and show off the results of my project. At this moment some may say I am past this stage because I finished presenting both in class and to the many students in HSTAT. On the other hand if someone wanted to see what I did in computer science during 11th grade, I would still be on this stage communicating and showing my results of my project.
### Skills
I enhance my communication skills with my set mindsets and my consideration of how to present my project.
#### Communication
As I said before, whenever I feel nervous I would tell myself to calm down and have a mindset such as your class is your friends or these people want to see your project and be excited with them. These really help me speak my mind out and be clear enough to get my main points of the project to the audience/user.
#### Consideration
There were many times when practicing for my presentation I would say completely different phrases to present my project. I eventually had to force myself to stick with a google slides transition and a phrase to explain a block of code. I choose my transition and phrases by two rules I made:
* Not complex enough so the audience would feel bored watching my presentation.
* Not too confusing so the audience doesn't want to pay attention anymore.

An example of a bad phrase was "These two scenes have the same code such as how they connect to this one function that would restart the game which proves how they reused the same code. This brings to my next point...." In my head this phrase got me confused on how I was transitioning from one point to another point. This got me thinking, If I am confused then other people would be confused too. So I reworded my phrase and ended with this: "These two scenes use the exact same code which you can see with Onkeypress, adding text and the same position. (switch slides) Another pattern I noticed...." This was more simple and easy to follow because I felt that these two points weren't meant to be connected at all so this way of transitioning would help the audience know I am talking about two completely different topics.
### Next Steps
After the results of who is going to be presenting in the auditorium I wasn't picked to be the one presenting but I had a fun time regardless. Next year I will be doing APCSA because I am interested and want to learn more about javascript and what more can you do with javascript so I am pretty excited for that.
