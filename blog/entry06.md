# Entry 6
##### 5/30/25

### Context
After completing my [platformer](keithh9704.github.io/sep11-freedom-project) with a beyond mvp functions I set for myself like moving platforms. I was getting ready to [present](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fUoSkmjh4CBsrn9RrNKb3pN7uRgoGRG1-a25Ok0i5gE) my project.
#### Presenting my project infront of the class
When I called to present my project I was caught by surprise because that day I didn't go over what I am going to say infront of the whole class. I went to present and I noticed myself using the same filler word alot such as "like", not making enough eye contact and I was shaking when I was trying to present my mvp/beyond mvp. 

Some takeaways I have from this presentation are:
* During presentation week no matter what day it is, I should spend 15-20 minutes practicing what I will say when I present. 
* During presenting I should calm myself down so I try to make the presentation more interactive with more eye contact.
#### Presenting my project in the expo
The experience I had at the expo to show my project to students in HSTAT was very nerveracking at first but I realized these people are here to be inspired on what we do for the SEP course. Having this mindset stuck to my head, I was ready to present to these people in the two periods we have to present. In the first period no one came to my side but one person and they seem really uninterested so I got my main points down to them like how to play my game, what did I use to make my project, the different features of my game, etc. In the second period there were a lot of people that came to my side and I presentated to my friends that are not in sep, juinors and seniors. Most of them liked my project and some of them thought this game should be copyrighted because of my sprite. Overall I had a really fun time during 2nd period and having this expo was fun because I get to show my friends, juniors and seniors what I been up to in this class. 

My Takeaway from the expo are:
* Be more clear so my presentation would flow better. The reason for this takeaway because when presenting to the judges, I knew what I was going to show them and say to them but the way I would transition to one thing to another wasn't the greatest. 
* Find better ways to show your project to others because when I had gifs on google slides, they would be really laggy and takes up to 10-20 seconds to fully load in.
