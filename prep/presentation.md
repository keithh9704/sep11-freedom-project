# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* To remind the audience of mario and capture their attention with them feeling like a child again playing mario.
  * Some along the lines (Have you ever thought what mario would look like if it was made by a high school student?)


## Product
* Live showing my project in front of class


## Process
* Showing many code overlapped each other (MVP)
  * Making gameover and winner scene is together with making the game restart from the key r.
  * Adding levels, counting score, etc all is made in one scene and to run again.
* Beyond MVP
  * Showing the how "patrol" works for an enemy
  * How I used this code to make moving platforms


## Conclusion
* Make a yellkey at the last slide
* Takeaways
  * Some concepts of code is 10 times out of 10 used for each other and if you try to break them apart they won't be used to its full potential.
    * Example is making levels and if I put in the scene not outside which would make teleporting to the next level way more complex and hard for the viewer to understand.
  * Taking each step of completing my mvp/beyond mvp at a time so I don't have to keep committing one mistake at a time.
    * For a viewer looking at my commits, It may be really messy since I have been committing so many times and each time is just a 1-2 lines of code changed or added. It would be more organized to either not be so in a rush when first creating the code and look for mistakes or/and have one big commit of fixing mistakes so all the mistakes I made are in one big commit.




<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
